## Task 5

Write a program that reads a text file containing strings made up of zeroes and ones. The program counts the number of ones per line.


Example:

| Input         | Output        | 
|---------------|---------------| 
| 0011          | 0011 - 2      | 
| 0101010       | 0101010 - 3   | 
| 01            | 01 - 1        | 
| 00000000      | 00000000 - 0  | 
| 1111          | 1111 - 4      |



## Task 6

Write a program that reads a text file containing lines of two numbers and a plus character in the middle. The program should add the two numbers and print the result.

Example:

| Input         | Output        | 
|---------------|---------------| 
| 1+1           | 1+1=1         | 
| 99+2          | 99+2=101      | 
| 1000+0        | 1000+0=1000   |
